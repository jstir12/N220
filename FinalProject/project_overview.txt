Project Title: Movie List Generator

Project Concept:
My project is a simple movie explorer that lets users load top rated movies, popular movies, upcoming releases, and also search for any movie by name. 
When the user clicks a button or searches, the page updates with new movie cards that show the poster, title, rating, release date, and a short overview.

Why I Chose This Theme:
I picked movies because the API is easy to work with, and it makes the project more fun and visual. 
It also gives me a good way to show dynamic UI changes and API calls without making the project overly complicated.

Interactive Features:
The site updates every time the user clicks a button or searches for a movie. 
All movie cards are created through JavaScript, and they fade in with a small JS animation. 
Hover effects also help make the cards feel more interactive.

Async Operation:
I used the TMDb API and fetch it with async/await. 
I make requests for top rated movies, popular movies, upcoming movies, and movie search. 
The responses come back as JSON and I loop through them to update the page.

Notes for the Grader:
My project uses DOM manipulation, event handling, async fetch with JSON, user input (movie search), and a JS-based motion effect on the cards. 
Everything updates dynamically without reloading the page.
